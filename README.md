# DPU
For learning to code!

## How To
The "Result" tab (above) is always kept up-to-date with your changes,
so there's no need to refresh anything. Actually _don't use the page refresh button_, because
that will reset everything back to how it started.

## Exercises
Try not to read the clues until you have to!
1. Change the DPU's name _(clue: look closely at the function `sayYourName` in built-ins.js)_
2. Create a new built-in variable called `yourName` with a value _(clue: look at `nameOfDpuOnRight`)_
3. Use `yourName` in `sayYourName` _(clue: replace `"George"`)_
4. Create a new built-in _function_ called `sayHello` which says `"Hello"` _(clue: make a copy of `sayYourName`)_
5. Make the DPU say "Hello" first, then say their name _(clue: add another line before `sayYourName` in `program.js`)_

## Bonus
Have a close look at `index.html`.
1. What _language_ do you think most of this is? (Actually there are _three_ languages in this one file!)
2. The main language is not like JavaScript. It has no _instructions_. Instead, it's just a lot of _keywords_ and _literals_ describing what we want the page to look like.
3. Can you find the code for the "Go" button? What do you think `onclick="go()"` means?
4. Try changing the effect of clicking the Go button to just say "Hello".
5. Try and figure out how to change the text on the Go button to "Say Hello".
6. Can you find how the second DPU is hidden if `noDpuOnRight` is set to `true`?
