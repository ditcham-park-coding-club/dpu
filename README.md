# dpu
For learning to code!

## Getting the Code
First open Atom and see if you already have the code available from last week. If not, you need to download the folder again from here. **Try to do it by yourself**, but if you run into trouble, here are some clues:

1. Click the green "Clone or download" button above and select "Download ZIP"
2. When the banner appears at the bottom of the page, click the "Save As..." button
3. Select your Desktop and then click "Save"
4. Now click the "Open" button
5. _Drag_ the "dpu-master" folder on the right onto the Desktop on the left
6. In Atom, in the File menu, choose Add Project Folder, and select the "dpu-master" folder from the Desktop

## Running the Code
To open the DPU web page, use Explorer to go into Desktop\\dpu-master and double-click on the "index" file.

When you have edited some code, remember to:
1. Save the file you have changed using _Ctrl+S_
2. Refresh the web page to see what has happened!

## Exercises
1. Change the DPU's name _(clue: look closely at the function `sayYourName` in built-ins.js)_
2. Create a new built-in variable called `yourName` with a value _(clue: look at `nameOfDpuOnRight`)_
3. Use `yourName` in `sayYourName` _(clue: replace `"George"`)_
4. Create a _function parameter_ for `sayYourName` called `whatToSay` _(clue: Google "javascript function parameter")_
5. _Pass_ the parameter from the program
